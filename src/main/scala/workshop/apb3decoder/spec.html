<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of this lab is to pratice with non trivial component parametrization</p>
<p>The component to implement is a fully asynchronous APB3 bus decoder,</p>
<p>This lab will introduce :
  - How the scala can be mixed with SpinalHDL for parametrization</p>
<h2>Parameter</h2>
<p>As you can see in the Apb3Decoder.scala, there is a <code>outputsMapping : Seq[Mapping]</code> parameter. It specify the number of output bus (<code>outputsMapping.length</code>) and where each of them should be mapped (base address / range). </p>
<h2>APB specification</h2>
<p>The APB bus is a very simple (and also old, but still used) peripheral bus. It is specified by ARM, but there is some typical chronograms : </p>
<p>Note : For this labs, you don't need to insert wait cycle on the bus, so you can keep the PREADY always high.</p>
